just some notes regarding the project...


Inferring model parameters (N=448, all regions)
Lilelihood computed from all data points

diffusion+aggregation+death
    works great

diffusion+aggregation
    works great (though a bit slow)

diffusion
    if including all data points, the model does not want to remove anterograde transport.
    The result is that the steady-state is homogeneous. This makes sense from the model formulation.
    If rho_ratio = 1, then the effective Laplacian is symmetric.

    if only including time points (1.0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0), the model prefers retrograde, however it sets the seed too low.
    The result is almost no pathology anywhere, though the order of pathology severity is preserved. 
    Might this be because, when including all data samples, most regions have many samples close to zero at all timepoints? inspecting the data, this looks plausible
    because when looking at predicted vs (mean) observed, it looks like increasing the seed would give a really good fit.
    Looks bizarre that the seed is estimated to be that low. And it is reproducible, I tried with different priors for the seed and 
    they give the same posterior.

    perhaps the only way to make the bayesian inference prefer a proper spreading is to fit to sample-averaged data points. 
    this did indeed work better, though I am still not satisfied
